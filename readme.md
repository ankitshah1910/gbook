Description:

1 Create an app with a form which searches the Google Books API.
1 Example of a google books api endpoint is: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?key=<VALID_API_KEY>&q=something
PS: Feel free to use any other API.
2 The app should display the result in a paginated fashion. 
1 The option of 5/10/20, etc should be provided to the user.
2 The results should be displayed in the following format:
first author [, second author [, third author….]] - title
3 Each result when clicked should expand to show its description if one exists.
1 If there is no description, please use your own imagination to convey this information to the user.
4 Use of Node.JS to interact with the Google Books API 
5 Unit testing
1 React JS
2 Node JS
6 In addition to the query results, display some statistics:
1 The total number of results
2 The name of the single author who appears most commonly in the results
3 Earliest and most recent publication dates within the search parameters
4 Server Response Time.

If you're on GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, or another public hosted version control, you can upload it there; otherwise, just get us a package we can stand up and run for ourselves.
